	<h3>Interactive Map of Potential Exposure to Abandoned Uranium Mines (AUMs) in Navajo Nation</h3>
          <p>Residents of Navajo Nation (Dine Bikeyah), a sovereign Indigenous Tribal nation of the American
            Southwest, are vulnerable to environmental pollution from various sources such as resource
            extraction and unregulated solid waste disposal (Kirkemeno et al. 1998; Ong et al. 2014; Lewis et
            al. 2017). For example, from the 1940s through the 1980s, one of the most sought-after resources
            was uranium, as evident by the hundreds of abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) across Navajo
            lands. This legacy of mining and continuing presence of AUMs has caused significant
            environmental contamination in Navajo Nation (Eichstaedt 1994; Masco 2013; Voyles 2015;
            Lewis et al. 2017). As a result, understanding the distribution of potential exposure to these AUMs
            is a significant concern in Navajo communities. Some recent work to model this exposure potential
            includes a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) (Malczewski 2006) model developed by Lin
            et al. (2020) to analyze and understand potential exposure within Navajo Nation.</p>
